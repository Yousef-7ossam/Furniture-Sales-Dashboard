üßπ Data Cleaning and Transformation (Power Query)

After uploading the dataset to Power Query, I performed several data cleaning and transformation steps to prepare it for analysis:

-Changed the Order Date and Ship Date columns to proper Date format.

-Encountered an error due to regional settings, so I switched the system locale to English (United States) to resolve it.

-Removed irrelevant columns that did not add analytical value.

-Added a new Duration column to calculate the shipping time between order and ship dates.

-Created a Month column using the first three letters of each month as a suffix (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar).

-Converted the Profit column to Currency format for better financial clarity.
